# MSc Thesis: Developing an Urban Digital Twin-Based Framework for Air Pollution Exposure Communicationâ€‹

This repository will hold all of the code developed for the implementation of an urban digital twin (UDT) for air pollution exposure estimation. While development has been happening for a while now, I have been using Git for version control since mid-June. This readme will have more details as the process wraps up. 

**simplified_executable_pollution_model.py**. 
This is a simplified version of the land use regression model used to generate air quality maps in the UDT, but which only calculates maps for individual pollutants and is designed to be run in the command line with various parameters (pollutant, date, map resolution). This relies on a spatial dataset which I have not uploaded to Github and API credentials which are not public, so it is not unfortunately not replicable at the moment.
