# MSc Thesis: Developing an Urban Digital Twin-Based Framework for Air Pollution Exposure Communicationâ€‹

This repository will hold all of the code developed for the implementation of an urban digital twin (UDT) for air pollution exposure communication. While I am not currently using Git version control in my development process, this may change in the near future.  
Currently, scripts will be uploaded when they are completed.
As of now, **(May 2025)** the only only script is **simplified_executable_pollution_model.py**. This is a simplified version of the land use regression model used to generate air quality maps in the UDT, but which only calculates maps for individual pollutants and is designed to be run in the command line with various parameters (pollutant, date, map resolution). This relies on a spatial dataset which I have not uploaded to Github and API credentials which are not public, so it is not unfortunately not replicable for others at the moment.
